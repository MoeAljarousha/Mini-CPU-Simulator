# Mini CPU Simulator

A simple and lightweight simulator that models the behavior of a basic CPU architecture. This project is designed to help users understand the fundamental components of a CPU, including the ALU, registers, instruction set, and memory. The simulator allows users to experiment with basic CPU operations and visualize how different instructions affect the CPU state.

## Features

- Simulates a basic CPU with registers, ALU, and memory.
- Supports a custom instruction set for simple operations (e.g., load, store, add).
- Real-time updates of register and memory states.
- Educational tool for understanding low-level CPU operations.

## Getting Started

To run the simulator locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- If you're working with C or a similar language, make sure you have a compiler installed (e.g., GCC for C).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mini-cpu-simulator.git
